# BruteForceCalculator
</div>
A Bash script to estimate the time required to brute-force a password based on user-defined or default hashing speeds, simulating the capabilities of advanced GPU clusters or supercomputers.

## Running the script

- Clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jerryjames2001/BruteForceCalculator.git
```
- Navigate to the directory:
```bash
    cd BruteForceCalculator
```
- Make the script executable:
```bash
    chmod +x BruteForceCalculator.sh
```
- Run the script:
```bash
    ./BruteForceCalculator.sh
```
## Features

- **Default and Custom Hash Rates**:
  - Uses a default hash rate of 10^17 hashes/second.
  - Option to input your own hash rate for flexibility.

- **Password Complexity**:
  - Works with passwords of any length and complexity.

- **Time Estimation**:
  - Calculates time in seconds, minutes, hours, days, or years, depending on the cracking duration.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Simple prompts for easy interaction and customization.

- **Loading Animation**:
  - Displays a terminal-based loading screen during calculations.

- **Educational Purpose**:
  - Highlights the importance of strong passwords and demonstrates how cracking time varies with computational power.
